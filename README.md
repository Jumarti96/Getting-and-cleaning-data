This repository contains a modified version of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smatphones" data set that can be found in the following link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In addition, the codebook of the new data set and the script performed to achieve the cleaning are provided.

## Description of the project
The objective of the project was to create a simplified version of the original data set. To achieve this, several modifications were carried on:

1.  combining the train and test data sets.

2.  replacing the variable names with more indicative ones.

3.  extracting only std and mean columns of all the features.

4.  calculating the mean of each feature grouped by subject and activity performed
